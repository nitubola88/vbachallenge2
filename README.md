Create a script that loops through all the stocks for each quarter and outputs the following information:

1.The ticker symbol

2.Quarterly change from the opening price at the beginning of a given quarter to the closing price at the end of that quarter.

3.The percentage change from the opening price at the beginning of a given quarter to the closing price at the end of that quarter.

4.The total stock volume of the stock.

5.Add functionality to your script to return the stock with the "Greatest % increase", "Greatest % decrease", and "Greatest total volume".

6.Make the appropriate adjustments to your VBA script to enable it to run on every worksheet (that is, every quarter) at once.
